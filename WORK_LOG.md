| Aug 30 | 6:05pm-6:35pm | I decided that I want to use recursion for my initial attempt to solve this problem. I will come at it in a similar way to how I solved the maze solver problem, where I used recursion to figure out how to solve the maze by keeping an array showing the squares where I've already gone. If I return to an old square, the recursion will end. Instead of returning a boolean with my recursive loop, I will be returning the array that I use to keep track of the visited squares. I will also use this array to see how many turns each path took. |

I also worked on figuring out how to what to return in my recursive function. I decided that it would be alot simpler to just have the function simply return the number of turns taken (an int) for the lowest board, returning the number of turns when the end square is reached, and -1 when an old square is revisited. I have made alterations to my code as such. |
| Aug 30 | 7:20pm-7:50pm |                    I have made good progress using an integer as my return type for my recursive method. I have now completed my turn counting method, and feel that I am almost done with my recursive method. I still am not done with my code completely, and still have some commenting, however I feel that I am close to finishing my first attempt. The actual method that returns the lowest number of turns will only have one for loop that calls the recursive method, and will return the lowest resulting value, -1 if solving not possible. |
